As a user, I want to be able to flip the top card of my deck and compare it against my opponent so I can play the game.
As a user, I want to be able to see the remaining number of cards in my deck so I can keep track of the game state.
As a user, I want to be informed when a ‘war’ is declared so that I can pay closer attention to an important game interaction.
As a user, I want to be informed when the game has ended so that I can choose to play again.
As a user, I want to see an overall game scoreboard so I can keep track of my W/L history in a single session.
